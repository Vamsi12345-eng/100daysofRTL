# 100daysofRTL
Any kind of goal need its shorter steps to succeed it. On Considering the goal i have. To be an RTL engineer also need its shorter steps to succeed it. That is #100daysofRTL. In this #100daysofRTL i am going to build logics , code the logics that i have build using HDL and verify them using HVL for 100 days. Lets hope for the best and keep going. 

Day_001 : Design and tested below mentioned logics:

1.Half adder(using Data Flow Method)

2.Full Adder using two Half Adders and one or gate.

3. 2:4 Decoder using Behavioral modelling.

4. 4:1 mux using 2:1 muxes. 


Day_002 : Design and tested below mentioned logics:
1. Bidirectional buffer(without any inout port just logic)
2. 4-Bit ripple carry adder using 1-bit full adder.
3. 4:1 mux using decoder & tristate buffer.
4. 8:3 priority encoder(behavoral modelling).

Day_003: ALU with 4 opcode instructions 
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Bitwise Xor Opeartion

Day_004 : Design and tested below mentioned logics:
1. D Flip flop using behavoral level modelling.
2. T flip flop using D flip flop.
3. 4 bit Synchronous Loadable up counter.


Day_005 : Design and tested below mentioned logics:
1. JK flipflop.
2. SR latch using Gate level modelling.
3. 4- bit MOD-12 asynchronous up counter using T- Flip FLop.

Day_006: Verilog code for sequence detector which detects the sequence - "1 0 1".

Day_007: Design and tested below mentioned logic:
1. 4 - Bit synchronous up/down counter.
2. 4 - Bit SISO.
