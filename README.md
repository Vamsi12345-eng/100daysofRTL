# 100daysofRTL
Any kind of goal need its shorter steps to succeed it. On Considering the goal i have. To be an RTL engineer also need its shorter steps to succeed it. That is #100daysofRTL. In this #100daysofRTL i am going to build logics , code the logics that i have build using HDL and verify them using HVL for 100 days. Lets hope for the best and keep going. 

Day_001 : Design and tested below mentioned logics:
1.Half adder(using Data Flow Method)
2.Full Adder using two Half Adders and one or gate.
3. 2:4 Decoder using Behavioral modelling.
4. 4:1 mux using 2:1 muxes.

Day_002 : Design and tested below mentioned logics:
1. Bidirectional buffer(without any inout port just logic)
2. 4-Bit ripple carry adder using 1-bit full adder.
3. 4:1 mux using decoder & tristate buffer.
4. 8:3 priority encoder(behavoral modelling).
